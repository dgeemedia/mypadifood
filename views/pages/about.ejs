      <h2>How MyPadiFood works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Vendors</strong> register their stalls and upload menu items
          and photos.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customers</strong> search by neighbourhood, LGA or meal and
          place orders for delivery or pickup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Riders</strong> deliver orders and earn extra income from
          completed trips.
        </li>
        <li>
          We handle payments, ratings and basic dispute resolution so trust can
          scale across the platform.

    <h2>Our story</h2>
    <p>
      MyPadiFood was built out of a simple idea: that great food and great
      livelihoods are often just around the corner — if only neighbours could
      discover and support local cooks more easily. We started by focusing on
      trust and simplicity: clear vendor profiles, fast ordering and fair
      payment flows. Over time the platform has grown into a place where small
      food entrepreneurs can build recurring customers and riders can earn
      dependable income.
